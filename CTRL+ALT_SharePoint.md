# Ctrl+alt SharePoint: governance that doesn’t suck

*If you’re contributing, you’re accountable. If you’re managing, you’re maintaining.*

## 🧭 Purpose of this site

This isn’t a storage unit. This is our operational home base. It exists to:

* Help people do work faster
* Surface what matters right now
* Preserve only what’s still useful

Everything else? Archive it, delete it, or don’t create it in the first place.

## 🧱 Our site structure

We organize by function—not org chart:

* **Do the work** → Projects, Sprints, Tasks
* **Run the org** → Policies, HR, IT
* **Know the why** → Strategy, OKRs, Planning

If you’re not sure where something belongs, ask. Don’t invent a new folder.

## 👤 Roles & responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| **Site Owner** | Overall structure, permissions, standards |
| **Content Owner** | Creates/edits specific pages or libraries |
| **Maintainer** | Reviews for staleness, structure, clarity |
| **User** | Flags broken/stale/outdated info |

If you create content, you own it. If you walk away, someone else must be assigned. Otherwise, it gets deleted.

## 📅 Review & maintenance schedule

| Task | Cadence | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Content freshness check | Monthly | Maintainers |
| Permissions audit | Quarterly | Site Owner |
| Structure review | Biannually | Site Owner |
| Broken link cleanup | Monthly | Maintainers |

> **Automated alerts via Power Automate will flag stale pages after 90 days of inactivity.**

## 🚫 Hard rules

* **No “Misc” folders.** If you don’t know what it is, don’t upload it.
* **No PDFs as navigation.** That’s lazy, inaccessible, and breaks search.
* **No duplicate versions.** Use version history or archive the old one.
* **No orphaned pages.** Everything must be linked from the homepage or a key hub.

## ✅ Best practices

* Add a “Last Updated” field to every list/view
* Use tags or columns, not folders, to filter
* Use clear, human‑readable titles (not `final_FINAL_v2`)
* Avoid one‑off sites—build within the main structure when possible

All changes are reviewed in our quarterly structure review.

## Final reminder

**You’re not creating for yourself. You’re building shared infrastructure.**  
If it’s not obvious where to find something, how to use it, or when it was last touched—fix it.

That’s good governance. That’s CTRL+ALT SharePoint.

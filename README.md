This README drops you straight into the guts of the **CTRL + ALT Collaboration Concept** repo—no fluff, no dividers, just what you need to start using (or critiquing) the frameworks inside.

## What this repo is

An evolving set of field‑tested frameworks and manifestos for rescuing collaboration platforms that have spiraled into chaos. Each document takes a “control–alternate–delete” approach (clean, tighten, reboot) to rip out bloat and rebuild workspaces that actually help people get work done. ([GitHub][1])

## Quick start

1. Clone or fork the repo.
2. Crack open the framework that matches your platform.
3. Run the **Clean → Tighten → Reboot** cycle on a pilot space.
4. Adapt, iterate, and—if you spot gaps—open a pull request.

## How to use the frameworks

### Clean the surface

Archive anything untouched in the last 60–90 days and tag the rest as **Active**, **Reference**, or **Trash Soon**.

### Tighten the structure

Re‑architect around real workflows, not org charts. Every page, database, or library must earn its place.

### Reboot with governance

Define clear roles, enforce content freshness checkpoints, and schedule quarterly CTRL + ALT cycles so the mess never returns.

## Contributing

* **Issues** – Open one if you hit a snag or have a brutal critique.
* **Pull requests** – Keep them laser‑focused: one improvement per PR, with a short rationale.
* **Style** – Sentence case headings, punchy prose, no corporate filler.

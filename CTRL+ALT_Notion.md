# CTRL+ALT Notion Framework
*A factory-reset button for your bloated workspace.*

> We were promised friction-free collaboration.  
> **The real problem?** Notion has become a digital junk drawer—emotional clutter masquerading as productivity.

---

## C — Clean the Surface
**Archive. Audit. Abandon what doesn’t move work.**

1. **Workspace Detox**  
   Archive anything untouched in the last 60-90 days—no sentimentality.

2. **Audit by *Use*, not nostalgia**  
   - Who actually opens this?  
   - What decision or action does it fuel?  
   - If it vanished tomorrow, would anyone care?

3. **Identify Redundant Rituals**  
   - Multiple sprint boards? Keep one.  
   - Retros with no follow-through? Purge.  
   - Owner-less meeting notes? Straight to archive.

> *“Most Notion messes aren’t technical—they’re emotional baggage.”*

## T — Tighten the Structure
**Design for execution, not ornamental dashboards.**

4. **Define Workspace Archetypes**  
   Map every page or database to a layer:  
   - **Ops** – tasks, projects, sprints  
   - **Knowledge** – docs, decisions, how-tos  
   - **Strategy** – roadmaps, OKRs, vision  
   - **Surface** – dashboards, indexes  
   If it doesn’t fit, it doesn’t live.

5. **Map Decision Loops**  
   `Idea → Proposal → Decision → Action`  
   `Question → Owner → Outcome → Archive`  
   Stop designing for hierarchy—design for momentum.

6. **The Three-Click Rule**  
   Anything critical in >3 clicks? You failed. Fix the path.

> *“A workspace is only as good as the friction it removes.”*

## R — Reboot with Intention
**Ownership, automation, and premeditated deletion.**

7. **Assign Stewardship**  
   - **Maintainer** – enforces hygiene  
   - **Decider** – governs structure  
   - **User group** – delivers ruthless feedback

8. **Build Expiry & Reset**  
   - Pages **stale-after-X-days** by default  
   - Docs reviewed quarterly—or archived  
   - Calendar-triggered audits keep the blade sharp

9. **Ship the Usage Guide**  
   One brutal page: where to put work, where decisions go, what not to touch.

---

## L — Lead with Learnability
**If it’s not obvious, it’s unusable.**

10. **“How to Use This Workspace” Doc** – 3-5 bullets. No fluff.  
11. **Embed UX Signposts** – start-here pages, stale-content call-outs, “What’s New” views.  
12. **Design for Onboarding** – role-based landing pages, template buttons, Loom walk-throughs.

> *“If your system needs a tour guide, it’s a maze—not a tool.”*

### 🔁 Quarterly CTRL+ALT+L Reset
Prune dead pages, review dashboard heatmaps, collect friction feedback—and kill one unused process on purpose. Until then, Notion stays a landfill.

---

### Final Reframe
Notion isn’t a warehouse for work. It’s the launchpad. **CTRL+ALT** is how you keep it from turning back into clutter.

# The CTRL+ALT Notion manifesto

*A new operating system for how I use Notion (and how I won’t).*

## 1. Notion isn’t broken, my workflows were

The tool didn’t fail—I let it become a digital junk drawer. Every tag, toggle, and nested dashboard was a cry for clarity wrapped in aesthetic noise.

No more. Every block must earn its place. No more productivity cosplay.

## 2. Templates are starting points, not destinations

I’m done hoarding layouts from influencers who’ve never shipped a real product. If a template doesn’t map to a real workflow I own, it’s gone.

Less cloning. More pruning.

## 3. Structure beats style

Pretty pages are useless if no one updates them. I’m designing for utility, not visual dopamine. If it doesn’t guide a decision, capture a fact, or kick off an action—it doesn’t belong.

Function over vibes.

## 4. Databases ≠ discipline

A Notion database isn’t a system—it’s a surface. I’ll kill redundant ones and refactor the rest to serve clear, bounded use cases.

No more five‑kanban‑board sprints. No more retro boards nobody opens.

## 5. Docs are dead weight unless they move work forward

I’ll treat Notion like a living ops layer, not a wiki graveyard. Every doc must tie to a next step, a team handshake, or a point of view. Otherwise? Delete.

## 6. Hygiene is a role, not a hope

I’ll either own the maintenance—or assign someone who will. A tool without stewardship is just future debt.

No more “we’ll clean it up later.” Later never comes.

## 7. Every workspace needs a reset button

I’ll build with exit velocity in mind. Nothing is too sacred to archive, delete, or sunset. If I haven’t opened it in 90 days, it’s gone.

CTRL+ALT. Reboot as needed.

**The goal? Less architecture. More acceleration.  
Notion should feel like a cockpit, not a museum.**
